## For Athena Award: Reflection

As a high school student, AP Exam score release day is incredibly stressful. When my AP Exam scores released in July, in order to procrastinate checking my scores, I decided to make something that would make it more fun to view them (that ended up not quite working, since I had to look at the HTML of the "View Scores" page in order to make this extension and accidentally spoiled the surprise). The main challenge I faced was learning React. I'd never used React before and wanted to use this project as a way to learn it. I had to take a break from working on the project to watch a few tutorials and actually learn how to use React so that I could build this.
